[Back to Overview](README.md)

## Welcome view

**Video on YouTube:** [First Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ffLB4a9APc&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=2&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

AsTeRICS Grid initially starts with a welcome view giving the choice between:

1. **Use AsTeRICS Grid without registration:** choose this option in order to create a local default user and directly start using AsTeRICS Grid.
2. **Register now:** choose this option in order to sign up for an online user, which makes it possible to synchronize the grids across devices.

See [Terms](01_terms.md#User) for more information about offline/online users.

## "Main" - view

**Videos on YouTube:** [Demo configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU4sI2UcNUo&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=3&t=0s), [Fullscreen and lock mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK8Lv2bVr-g&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=4&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

Once taken a decision in the welcome view AsTeRICS Grid subsequently starts in the "main view" which looks like Figure 1 (desktop view on the left, mobile view on the right):

![main view](./img/main_en.jpg)

These are the possible options:

1. **New Grid**: creates a new and empty grid, same as Fig. 3, number 3
2. **Save backup to file**: creates and downloads a `.grd` file containing a backup of all current grids, dictionaries and input configuration. In this case, a file called `asterics-grid-backup.grd` is downloaded that can be renamed to more easily identify the contents of the copy

7. **Reset to default configuration**: deletes all current grids and replaces them with the default demo configuration

**Info about Open Board Format (OBF)**: OBF is an open format for exchanging grids across different AAC tools and is specified on the [official website](https://www.openboardformat.org/). AsTeRICS Grid supports importing OBF files (`.obf` and `.obz`) using the options *Restore backup from file* or *Import custom data from file*.

**Video on YouTube:** [Complex grids and OBF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpez_-4ILRA&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=26&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

### Global grid

**Video on YouTube:** [Global Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbmMODbqbhk&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=25&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

A global grid is a grid that is visible on every grid page. It may contain general elements that make sense within every grid like e.g. a "Home" grid element that navigates to the start page. A global grid could also contain some kind of core vocabulary that should be visible any time. The global grid of the main page of figure 1 contains the following elements: 

![global grid](./img/global_grid_empty_en.JPG)

*Fig.3.2: Global Grid*

All the elements shown here are elements contained within the global grid. They are visible on every grid page.
While editing the global grid it's possible to define its height by opening *More -> Change grid dimensions* and setting the value for *height of first global grid row*.

The global grid can be activated/deactivated and edited in the "Manage Grids" view at the bottom or by *More -> Edit global grid* while editing any other grid: 

![de/activate global grid](./img/global_grid_en.JPG)

*Fig.3.3: "Manage grids" - view - Global Grid*

### Home grid

At the bottom of "Manage grids" it's possible to define a `Home grid`. This grid is automatically opened at startup of AsTeRICS Grid. If no home grid is defined, the last opened grid is opened.

`Navigate to home grid after selecting an element` can be selected in order to automatically navigate to home grid after any element (which doesn't navigate to an other grid) is selected. This can speed up the construction of sentences in more complex communicator interfaces.

It's possible to define an action that navigates to the home grid, see [action "Navigate to other grid"](05_actions.md#navigate-to-other-grid).

## "Manage Dictionaries" - view

**Video on YouTube:** [Manage dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS9om8MDEDY&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=19&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

In the manage dictionaries view currently saved dictionaries that are used for filling prediction elements (see [Terms](01_terms.md#grid-element)) can be shown and adapted (Figure 4):

![manage dictionaries view](./img/manage_dict_en.jpg)
*Fig. 4: "Manage dictionaries" - view (desktop view on the left, mobile view on the right)*

The following elements are available in the manage dictionaries view:

1. Open or close the navigation sidebar
2. **Import dictionary**: imports a dictionary from online dictionaries or from a `.json` file
3. **New empty dictionary**: add a new, empty dictionary
4. **Edit**: show, edit and add new words to the dictionary
5. **Clone**: create a copy of the dictionary
6. **Delete**: removes the dictionary
7. **Save**: saves the dictionary as `.json` file
8. **Edit dictionary name**: change the name of a dictionary

For more information about using dictionaries see [Dictionaries](07_dictionaries.md).

## "Change User" - view

**Video on YouTube:** [Offline and online users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoRUQJJnYaY&list=PL0UXHkT03dGrIHldlEKR0ZWfNMkShuTNz&index=16&t=0s) (German, but auto-translated subtitles available)

In the "Change User" - view it's possible to switch between users or login an existing one (Figure 5):

![change user view](./img/login_en.jpg)
*Fig. 5: "Change user" - view (desktop view on the left, mobile view on the right)*

The following elements are available in the change users view:

1. Open or close the navigation sidebar
2. **Active offline user**: the currently active user is recognizable by a black user symbol and the word "active" next to the username. The active user is the user whose grids and configuration are currently used and shown in all other views. 
3. **Inactive online user**: The little cloud symbol indicates an online user (see [Terms](01_terms.md#user)) and the gray user symbol that he is currently inactive, meaning that the user's grids are currently not used.
4. **Inactive offline user**: The gray user symbol without a cloud indicates an inactive offline user (see [Terms](01_terms.md#user))
5. **Open**: sets the user "active" and opens the main view, showing the user's grid(s). Sets all other users inactive, there is always only one active user.
6. **Delete**: deletes the user and all of his grids and configuration. Use with caution, this action cannot be undone. This option is only available for offline users.
7. **Logout**: deletes the user and all of his grids and configuration, but only on the current device. Data in the cloud and on other devices that are logged in with the same user will not be deleted. This option is only available for online users.
8. **Login with other user**: put in username and password of an existing online user in order to add it to the current device. In order to create a new online or offline user, follow one of the links below.
9. **Remember checkbox**: if checked, the newly logged in online user will be saved to the device and listed in the list of users in the current user view. If unchecked the user will only be opened temporarily and no user data will be saved on the device (recommended for logging in on foreign devices).

For information about offline or online users and how to add them see [Users](06_users.md).

## Search function
These are the possibilities to open the dialog for searching for grid elements in the current configuration:
1. Click the button `Search` in the top bar in the Main View
2. Press `Ctrl + F` on the keyboard in one of these views: "Main", "Manage Grids" or "Edit grid"
3. Click on `More -> Search` in the top bar of "Edit grid" view
4. Grid element action [navigate to other grid](05_actions.md#navigate-to-other-grid) with navigation type `Open search dialog` (e.g. to be added to [global grid](02_navigation.md#global-grid) in order to be able to open the search dialog in fullscreen mode).

![change user view](./img/search-dialog.png)
*Fig. 6: Search dialog and search results*

Figure 6 shows the search dialog:
1. **search term**: text input field for the search term
2. **result image**: directly navigates to the selected element and highlights it. Keyboard shortcut for first search result: `[Enter]`
